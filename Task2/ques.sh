#Method 3 ----> This method will not also Count spaces along with alphabet 
: '
-c: It is used to count how many times a line repeated in the searching data and the values are shown as the prefix of that line.
sort : will sort the file in order numbers -> string
sort -nr: Will sort the output in descending order of occurance where count is added as a prefix in to a line
Time Complexity : 立((N/M)log(N/M)/log(R)) + 立((N/M)log(N/M)/log(R)) === 立((N/M)log(N/M)/log(R))
